# About NodePolus

NodePolus is an open-source Among Us server implementation written in Typescript. Some of the features of NodePolus include:

- A **_server-authoritative_** region server

  **The server is in control** of the game state, **not the host** of a game.
- An announcement server

  Keep your players up-to-date using the game's built-in announcement window.
- Plugin support

  Build **custom gamemodes**, support **custom maps and mods**, integrate with external services, and more (_this is in an early stage of development and may change in the future_).
- Extensive API

  Interact with all facets of a game: the players, their raw connections, ship systems, and more.
- Events

  Listen to, modify, and cancel multiple types of events--this enables server-side task selection, **force impostor**, cancelling sabotages, and more.
- Command framework

  Define custom chat and console commands using a simple and intuitive API (_coming soon_).
- Custom packets

  Register custom packets of each type with their own handler (_this is in an early stage of development and may change in the future_).

NodePolus is being actively developed, and you can usually find us in [our Discord server][Discord]. If you would like to play on a large-scale server that uses NodePolus, check out [Polus.gg](https://polus.gg) and play some custom gamemodes!
